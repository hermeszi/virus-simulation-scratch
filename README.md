# 🦠 COVID-19 Spread Simulation

During covid, I was still running online coding classes.

I did a Scratch project with the students(ages 9-14) to demonstrate virus spread patterns in a population.

## 🎯 Educational Objectives

This simulation helps students understand:
- How viruses spread through a population
- The concept of transmission rates
- Why preventive measures work (and their limitations)
- Data visualization through simple graphing

## 🔬 Simulation Details

### Basic Mechanics
- Population: 100 dots moving randomly in 2D space
- Initial condition: One infected individual (red dot)
- Transmission: Contact between infected and healthy individuals
- Recovery: All infected individuals eventually recover
- Real-time graph: Tracks number of infected individuals over time

### Isolation Demonstration
The simulation includes a barrier with a small gap to demonstrate:
- The effect of partial isolation measures
- Why 100% isolation is needed to completely prevent spread
- How even small gaps in containment can lead to full population exposure

## 📊 Key Observations

1. Bell Curve Pattern
   - Almost all runs result in a bell-shaped infection curve
   - This pattern is consistent with real-world epidemics

2. Isolation Effects
   - Partial isolation delays but doesn't prevent spread
   - Demonstrates why preventive measures (like masks - which lower chances of transmition) are necessary.

## 🎮 How to Use

### Run Online
You can run this simulation directly in your browser:
- [Scratch Editor](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/379048645/editor/) - Official Scratch platform
- [TurboWarp](https://turbowarp.org/379048645) - Alternative platform with better performance

### Run Locally
1. Download the `.sb3` file from the `simulation` folder
2. Open it in [Scratch Editor](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/)
3. Click the green flag to start
4. Observe the spread pattern and resulting graph

## 📚 Discussion Notes

- Start by asking students to predict the graph shape
- Discuss why the curve is bell-shaped
- Compare with real-world COVID-19 data
- Explore how changing parameters affects outcomes
- Use the demo to discuss public health measures

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

The simulation uses:
- Sprite cloning for population
- Collision detection for transmission
- Variables for tracking infected count
- Pen tool for real-time graphing
- Basic physics for movement
- Boolean logic for state changes
